Project overview

A bank's credit card department is one of the top adopters of data science. A top focus for the bank has always been acquiring new credit card customers. Giving out credit cards without doing proper research or evaluating applicants' creditworthiness is quite risky. The credit card department has been using a data-driven system for credit assessment called Credit Scoring for many years, and the model is known as an application scorecard. A credit card application's cutoff value is determined using the application scorecard, which also aids in estimating the applicant's level of risk. This decision is made based on strategic priority at a given time. Customers must fill out a form, either physically or online, to apply for a credit card. The application data is used to evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness. The decision is made using the application data in addition to the Credit Bureau Score, such as the FICO Score in the US or the CIBIL Score in India, and other internal information on the applicants. Additionally, the banks are rapidly taking a lot of outside data into account to enhance the caliber of credit judgements.

Project objective

The main objective of this assignment is to minimize the risk and maximize the profit of the bank. Bank has to make a decision based on the applicant's profile to minimize the loss from the bank's perspective. Bank considers the applicant's over their nature of work, income range and family orientaion details to take any decision to approve or reject a credit card application. The customer Credit card data contains many features and a classification approach to identify the credit worthiness of an applicant. In this project we are utilizing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) as a data exploration technique to acquire knowledge, discover new relations, apply new methodologies and unravel patterns in data. It is important to apply the necessary rationale behind each step to address the main objective of the study. So, The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model for Credit Card Approval Prediction.

Why is your proposal important in today’s world? How predicting a good client is worthy for a bank?
In today's world, the proposal holds significant importance as it empowers financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions. Banks and financial institutions have vested interest in identifying and serving clients who are likely to be creditworthy and financially stable, here are why predictig good clients are worthy for banks:

Risk Mitigation:---> Banks face significant financial risks when extending credit to individuals who may default on their payments. Predictive models help identify clients who are more likely to meet their financial obligations, reducing the risk of bad loans and potential financial losses.

Improved Profitability:---> By accurately identifying creditworthy clients, banks can increase their profitability. These clients are more likely to make on-time payments, incurring fewer late fees and lower interest rates, which can positively affect the bank's revenue.

Enhanced Customer Experience:---> Predictive models not only help in identifying good clients but also contribute to a better customer experience. When deserving clients are approved more quickly, it leads to customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Efficient Resource Allocation:---> The bank can allocate its resources more efficiently by concentrating on creditworthy clients. This reduces the cost of chasing bad debts and streamlines the loan approval process, making it more cost-effective.

Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:---> Many regulatory authorities require banks to demonstrate responsible lending practices. Predictive models ensure that banks adhere to these regulations by ensuring loans are granted to clients who can afford them.

Competitive Advantage:---> In a competitive financial market, banks that can accurately assess creditworthiness can attract better clients and gain a competitive advantage over others. This leads to increased market share and business growth.

Data-Driven Decision-Making:---> The modern world relies heavily on data-driven decision-making. Credit approval prediction leverages data science and analytics to make informed choices, contributing to the growing trend of data-driven banking.

--->Predicting good clients is essential for a bank to reduce risks, increase profitability, improve the customer experience, and stay compliant with regulatory requirements. It also provides a competitive edge and aligns with the data-centric approach prevalent in today's financial industry.

How is it going to impact the banking sector?
The proposal's implementation is poised to have a profound impact on the banking sector. By enhancing the ability to predict creditworthiness, banks can significantly reduce the risk associated with lending. This, in turn, can lead to a more stable financial environment, with fewer defaults and bad loans. Moreover, it can streamline the lending process, making it more efficient and customer-centric, thereby improving the overall customer experience.

Furthermore, as regulatory authorities increasingly emphasize responsible lending practices, implementing such predictive models becomes essential for compliance. Banks that effectively employ these tools will not only meet regulatory requirements but also gain a competitive edge in the industry, attracting more desirable clients and ultimately increasing market share.

Ultimately, the proposal's impact is multifaceted, spanning risk reduction, improved efficiency, regulatory compliance, and competitiveness, making it a transformative force in the modern banking sector.

If any, what is the gap in the knowledge or how your proposed method can be helpful if required in future for any bank in India.
The proposed creditworthiness prediction method can indeed be beneficial for banks in India, but there are potential gaps in knowledge and considerations for its future implementation. One major challenge is the availability and quality of data. Indian banks often deal with a diverse customer base, and data quality and coverage can vary significantly. Ensuring the collection and maintenance of accurate and comprehensive data is crucial for the success of any predictive model.

Additionally, the legal and regulatory landscape in India is subject to change. Banking regulations, privacy laws, and data protection requirements can evolve, affecting the way customer data can be utilized. Continuous monitoring and adaptation to these legal changes will be necessary to ensure compliance.

Furthermore, the method's success will depend on continuous model retraining to adapt to changing economic conditions and customer behaviors. The dynamic nature of the Indian economy necessitates constant updates to maintain prediction accuracy.

In conclusion, while the proposed method offers significant benefits to banks in India, addressing data quality, staying compliant with evolving regulations, and maintaining model accuracy over time are key considerations for its successful implementation in the future.

Section 2:- Initial Hypothesis (or hypotheses) The initial hypotheses would revolve around identifying patterns and important features that impact a machine learning (ML) model's ability to predict creditworthiness.

Hypothesis 1: Credit Score Correlation ---> there is a strong positive correlation between credit scores and credit card approval. Applicants with higher credit scores are more likely to be approved.

Hypothesis 2: Income Influence ---> It seems that a higher income level is positively associated with credit card approval. Those with greater income are more likely to have the means to meet their financial obligations.

Hypothesis 3: Employment Status ---> Employed applicants have a higher likelihood of approval compared to unemployed or self-employed applicants due to a stable income source.

Hypothesis 4: Debt-to-Income Ratio ---> A lower debt-to-income ratio will positively influence approval, as it indicates a lower financial burden for the applicant.

Hypothesis 5: Age Factor ---> Age may play a role in approval, with older applicants being favored as they might be perceived as more financially responsible.

Hypothesis 6: Address Stability ---> Individuals with a longer history at their current address may have a higher likelihood of approval, reflecting stability.

These initial hypotheses serve as starting points for the data analysis, helping to identify the significant factors that impact credit card approval and guiding the feature selection and engineering process for the ML model.
